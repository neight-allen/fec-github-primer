- Background
  - What is Version Control?
  - How does Git control versions?
    - Distributed version control
      - You clone the entire repository, and it lives on it's own in your machine. There's no locking of files or "checking out"
      - Practically speaking, the "origin" is the authority
    - Git is powerful, git is not easy
      - Things that seemed to work before suddenly don't. And Git is not very helpful in fixing these things
  - What is Github?
    - Github is a place to host your git repository
    - Github is built for collaboration, public and private
- Get up and running
  - Installing Git
    - Mac
      - Install Homebrew: http://brew.sh/
      - Install Git: brew install git
    - Windows
      - https://git-scm.herokuapp.com/downloads
  - Setting up Github
    - Sign up for an account
      - https://github.com/join
    - Create and link your SSH key
      - https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
    - Create or find a repo
    - Clone the repo to your local machine
- Uses
  - Git
    - Some Terms
      - Repository
        - Where all of the code and code versions are held
      - Commit
        - Practically: a version of code
        - Technically: a changeset
        - Has an identifier. Referred to as the SHA
      - Branch
        - A set of commits
      - Merge
        - Bringing commits from one branch into another
    - Git-Flow
      - Git Flow is a pattern for using Git
      - Master branch
        - A history of your code.
        - Keeps versions all day long, but what if you want to commit changes that aren't ready? And you should commit changes that aren't ready.
      - Develop Branch
        - git checkout -b develop
        - Is a place for you to put code that is mostly ready to go, but probably has some bugs.
        - Works great for keeping versions of buggy code.
        - What if you're working with others?
      - Features branches
        - git checkout -b a-new-hope
        - A place for you to work on a self contained feature
        - What if develop isn't ready to go to production?
      - Release
        - git checkout develop
        - git checkout -b release-1.3
        - Release branches are meant for only bug fixes
        - What if you have a bug that made it to production?
      - Hotfix branches
        - You can branch off of master, make a small change, and merge back in
      - http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
    - Merge Conflicts
      - If you change the same line on two different branches, you will get a merge conflict
      - They're not easy to resolve. I recommend getting a tool. I use diffmerge because it's free, but it's not the best.
    - Other handy things
      - Reset
        - Made changes to master that should have been on develop
        - git reset HEAD~1 --hard
        - git reset a4897fb2 --hard
      - cherry-pick
        - Allows you to merge in a single commit instead of a branch
      - How big should a commit be?
        - Smaller than yo
    - Common Error messages
      - Can't push
      - Can't checkout
  - Github
    - Teach yourself code
      - Find a project written in the language or framework you want to get better at
    - Deal with bad documentation
      - Dig into the code to see how it works
    - Find a library, framework or tool that solves a problem for you
    - Join an open source project
    - Hosting with Github Pages
      - https://guides.github.com/features/pages/
    - Team
      - Creating your team
        - Collaborators
          - You have control over the level of access of your collaborators
          - In public repositories
      - Bug reporting
        - Issues
          - Flexible
          - Usually used for tracking bugs and/or features
      - Code reviews
        - Pull Requests
          - A way for collaborators on a project to review a large chunk of code that's been written before merging
          - Steps in a Pull request
            - Make some commits on a branch or on a fork
            - Push your commits to github
            - Go to the origin repository, and initiate a pull request
            - Others can now review your code and approve your pull request
            - When the pull request is approved, it will be merged
      - History
        - Commit history
          - Simple view showing who has committed and when
          - You can also look at the details of any individual commit
        - Blame
          - When looking at a file, see who committed that line
        - Diff
      - Documentation (Markdown)
        - Github will render many different formats, but markdown is the most common
        - The Readme.md file in any folder will be displayed when you navigate there
